## Overview

FeatureSignals is built as **compliance-ready infrastructure** for feature flag management. The product's security architecture, data protection controls, and operational practices are designed to map to enterprise compliance frameworks. However, FeatureSignals has **not yet completed formal certification audits** for any compliance framework. This page describes the current posture, implemented controls, and certification roadmap for each framework.

**Current posture:** Technical controls are implemented and documented against SOC 2, ISO 27001, ISO 27701, GDPR, CCPA/CPRA, HIPAA, CSA STAR, DPF, and DORA requirements. Formal certification audits are on the roadmap, sequenced as SOC 2 Type II → ISO 27001 → ISO 27701.

**Target certifications (planned, not achieved):**

| Certification | Status | Roadmap |
|---|---|---|
| SOC 2 Type II | Controls mapped, evidence collection automated | Observation period target: 2026–2027 |
| ISO 27001 | ISMS documented, Annex A controls mapped | Stage 1 audit after SOC 2 |
| ISO 27701 | PIMS mapped as ISO 27001 extension | After ISO 27001 certification |
| CSA STAR | Self-assessment (Level 1) completed | Level 2 (third-party) post-ISO 27001 |
| EU-U.S. DPF | Not certified; SCCs are primary mechanism | Evaluating participation |
| HIPAA | BAA available, technical safeguards mapped | No formal HIPAA audit planned |

---

## Data Protection

### Encryption Standards

| Layer | Algorithm / Protocol | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **In transit** | TLS 1.3 (minimum 1.2) | All API communication, Flag Engine, SDK ↔ API |
| **At rest** | AES-256 | Database storage, backups |
| **Passwords** | bcrypt (cost factor 12) | User authentication credentials |
| **API keys** | SHA-256 one-way hash | Server SDK authentication keys |
| **Audit integrity** | SHA-256 chain hashing | Immutable audit trail, tamper detection |

Source: `docs/docs/compliance/security-overview.md` — encryption section.

### Data Retention

Retention periods are defined per data type and plan tier. A daily scheduled job purges expired data:

| Data Type | Free / Pro | Enterprise |
|---|---|---|
| User accounts | Account lifetime + 30-day grace period | Same |
| Organizations | Until deletion (90-day inactivity warning for free) | Same |
| Projects, flags, segments | Until deletion (cascade with org) | Same |
| Audit logs | Free: 30 days / Pro: 90 days | Configurable (unlimited) |
| Evaluation metrics | 30-day rolling window (aggregated, no PII) | Same |
| Login attempts | 90 days | Same |

**Deletion process:**
1. Account soft-deleted immediately (login blocked)
2. 30-day grace period allows recovery
3. Hard-deletion after grace period
4. Audit log entries anonymized — actor replaced with `"deleted-user-xxx"`
5. Evaluation context data is **never stored** — processed in-memory only, no deletion needed

Source: `docs/docs/compliance/data-retention.md` — retention schedule and automated purge.

### Sub-processors

FeatureSignals uses a minimal sub-processor model. Customers are notified at least 30 days before any new sub-processor is engaged.

| Sub-processor | Purpose | Data Processed | Location |
|---|---|---|---|
| Cloud hosting provider | Application hosting, database | All service data | Per deployment configuration |
| Email service provider | Transactional emails (OTP, notifications) | Email address, name | Provider's infrastructure |

For on-premises deployments, FeatureSignals does **not** act as a sub-processor — all data processing occurs within the customer's infrastructure.

Source: `docs/docs/compliance/subprocessors.md` — current sub-processor list.

## Security Standards

### Authentication Methods

| Method | Use Case | Implementation |
|---|---|---|
| **JWT (access token)** | Management API, Flag Engine | 1-hour TTL, refresh token rotation (7 days), server-side revocation via `jti` claim |
| **API key** | Server SDKs, Evaluation API | SHA-256 hashed; raw key shown once at creation; revocable |
| **SSO (SAML 2.0)** | Enterprise identity provider | Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin, etc. |
| **SSO (OIDC)** | Enterprise identity provider | Any OIDC-compliant IdP |
| **MFA (TOTP)** | Second factor authentication | RFC 6238 TOTP, Google Authenticator / Authy compatible |

### Authorization (RBAC)

Four built-in roles. Permissions escalate from Viewer → Developer → Admin → Owner:

| Permission | Viewer | Developer | Admin | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Read flags, projects, segments | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Create / edit flags | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Toggle flags (production) | No | Per-environment | Yes | Yes |
| Manage team members | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| Billing, API keys, SSO | No | No | No | Yes |

**Per-environment permissions:** Granular `can_toggle` and `can_edit_rules` controls allow restricting flag changes to specific environments.

### API Key Hashing

- API keys stored as SHA-256 one-way hashes in the database
- Raw key shown **once** at creation time; never accessible again
- Server-side revocation invalidates keys immediately
- Key format: `fs_sk_{base64url(payload)}.{HMAC-SHA256 signature}` (used for cell routing)

### CORS Configuration

Strict origin allowlist enforced at the middleware level:

```go
var allowedOrigins = map[string]bool{
    "https://app.featuresignals.com":  true,
    "https://featuresignals.com":      true,
    "https://docs.featuresignals.com": true,
    "http://localhost:3000":           true,
    "http://localhost:3001":           true,
    "http://127.0.0.1:3000":          true,
}
```

No wildcard origins in production. Source: `ARCHITECTURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md` — CORS section.

### Rate Limiting

| Endpoint Type | Limit | Middleware |
|---|---|---|
| Authentication (login, register) | 20 requests / minute | `middleware.RateLimit` |
| Management API (mutations) | 100 requests / minute | `middleware.RateLimit` |
| Evaluation API | 1,000 requests / minute | `middleware.RateLimit` |

Rate limits are applied at both Cloudflare (edge) and the Central API Server (application). Cloudflare limits act as a first-pass filter; application-level limits provide finer-grained per-route control.

### Input Validation

- `DisallowUnknownFields()` on all JSON decoders — prevents mass-assignment attacks
- Request body size limited to **1 MB** via `middleware.MaxBodySize`
- SQL queries use **parameterized statements** exclusively — never interpolate user input
- User endpoints validated against defined schemas before reaching store layer

### Security Headers

Every HTTP response includes:

| Header | Value |
|---|---|
| `Content-Security-Policy` | Tightly scoped per resource |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` |
| `X-Frame-Options` | `DENY` |
| `Referrer-Policy` | `strict-origin-when-cross-origin` |
| `Permissions-Policy` | Restricted camera, microphone, geolocation, payment |
| `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy` | `same-origin` |
| `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy` | `same-origin` |
| `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy` | `require-corp` |

Source: `docs/docs/compliance/security-overview.md` — security headers section, confirmed in `ARCHITECTURE_IMPLEMENTATION.md`.

## Compliance Frameworks

### SOC 2

**Status:** Controls mapping complete. Formal Type II audit is **planned, not achieved.**

The SOC 2 controls matrix maps all five Trust Service Criteria (Security, Availability, Processing Integrity, Confidentiality, Privacy) to FeatureSignals' technical controls. Evidence collection is automated through CI/CD pipeline logs, audit log exports, and vulnerability scanning reports.

| TSC Category | Coverage |
|---|---|
| CC1 — Control Environment | Code of conduct, RBAC, security training |
| CC2 — Communication | Structured logging, privacy policy, DPA |
| CC3 — Risk Assessment | Risk register, vulnerability scanning, change impact |
| CC5 — Control Activities | CI/CD pipeline, Infrastructure as Code |
| CC6 — Logical & Physical Access | JWT, API keys, MFA, SSO, IP allowlisting, TLS 1.3, AES-256 |
| CC7 — System Operations | Monitoring, anomaly detection, incident response |
| CC8 — Change Management | Git-based workflow, PR reviews, staging environment |
| CC9 — Risk Mitigation | Circuit breakers, graceful degradation, vendor management |

**Roadmap:**
1. ✅ Controls documented and implemented
2. ✅ Evidence collection automated (audit logs, scan reports, CI records)
3. 🔄 Gap assessment and remediation (in progress)
4. ⏳ Observation period (minimum 3–6 months)
5. ⏳ Auditor engagement and Type II examination

Sources: `docs/docs/compliance/soc2/controls-matrix.md`, `docs/docs/compliance/soc2/evidence-collection.md`, `docs/docs/compliance/soc2/incident-response.md`.

### ISO 27701

**Status:** Privacy Information Management System (PIMS) mapped as ISO 27001 extension. **Not certified.**

ISO 27701 extends ISO 27001 with privacy-specific controls. FeatureSignals operates as both:

- **PII Controller** — for customer account data (name, email, billing)
- **PII Processor** — for evaluation context data (passed by customers, processed in-memory only)

**Key controls implemented:**

| ISO 27701 Clause | Implementation |
|---|---|
| 7.2.5 — Privacy impact assessment | Completed for evaluation engine, audit system, SSO |
| 7.3.6 — Access to PII | Data export API (`GET /v1/users/me/data`) |
| 7.3.9 — De-identification and deletion | Account deletion with anonymized audit logs |
| 7.4.5 — End-of-processing deletion | Data retention policy with automated purge |
| 7.5.1 — International transfer | SCCs (not DPF-certified; see DPF section) |
| 8.5.1 — Breach notification | 72-hour notification commitment in DPA |

**ROPA (Record of Processing Activities):**

| Activity | Data Categories | Retention | Legal Basis |
|---|---|---|---|
| Account management | Name, email | Account lifetime + 30 days | Contract |
| Authentication | Email, password hash, MFA seed | Account lifetime | Contract |
| Billing | Billing contact, plan | 7 years (tax) | Contract |
| Audit logging | User ID, IP, action | See retention above | Legitimate interest |
| Flag evaluation | Targeting attributes | Not stored (in-memory) | Contract (processor) |

**Gap:** ISO 27701 certification is gated behind ISO 27001 certification.

Source: `docs/docs/compliance/iso27701/pims-overview.md`.

## Security Architecture — Five-Layer Defense

FeatureSignals implements a **five-layer defense-in-depth** model. Each layer validates independently — no trust is placed between layers.

```
 Layer 1:  Cloudflare (CDN / Edge WAF)
 Layer 2:  Central API Server (auth, validation, rate limiting)
 Layer 3:  Cell Router (API key validation, tenant routing)
 Layer 4:  Cell Internal (k3s cluster isolation)
 Layer 5:  CI/CD Pipeline (build → scan → deploy)
```

### Layer 1: CDN / Edge (Cloudflare)

| Control | Detail |
|---|---|
| WAF | Blocks SQLi, XSS, path traversal, bot attacks at the edge |
| DDoS | Cloudflare absorbs L3/L4/L7 attacks |
| Rate limiting | 100 req/min per IP (API), 1000 req/min (evaluation) |
| TLS | Cloudflare-managed certs; enforces TLS 1.3; HTTP → HTTPS redirect |
| Bot management | Bot score check on login/signup |
| Geo-blocking | Optional — block traffic from non-service regions |

### Layer 2: Central API Server

| Control | Detail |
|---|---|
| JWT auth | 1-hour TTL access token + 7-day refresh token rotation |
| API key auth | SHA-256 hashed; raw key shown once at creation |
| RBAC | Owner, admin, developer, viewer — enforced per-route via `middleware.RequireRole` |
| Input validation | `DisallowUnknownFields()` on JSON decoders — blocks mass-assignment |
| Body size limit | 1 MB max via `middleware.MaxBodySize` |
| Rate limiting | Per-route: 20/min auth, 100/min mutations, 1000/min eval |
| CORS | Strict origin allowlist — no wildcards |
| Tenant isolation | All queries scoped by `org_id`; cross-tenant access returns 404 |
| Audit logging | All mutating operations logged with user, action, target, IP |
| Log scrubbing | Middleware redacts `password`, `token`, `secret`, `key` from logs |

### Layer 3: Cell Router

- API keys are signed HMAC-SHA256 tokens containing tenant and cell routing info
- Validation: prefix check → signature verification → expiry check → tenant extraction
- **Never forward unauthenticated requests** to cells

### Layer 4: Cell Internal (k3s)

| Control | Detail |
|---|---|
| Network isolation | No public ports except SSH (ops-team only); app ports are ClusterIP |
| SSH access | Key-based only; root login via SSH key; passwords disabled |
| Firewall | Allow SSH from ops-team IPs; allow internal traffic; deny everything else |
| iptables | DROP default policy; allow loopback, established connections, k3s networks |
| PostgreSQL | Listen on ClusterIP only; strong password; no default users |
| k3s hardening | `--disable-cloud-controller`, `--kubelet-arg=protect-kernel-defaults=true` |
| Secrets | k3s Secrets mounted as files (not env vars) |
| Rate-limited SSH | iptables: 4 new SSH connections per 60 seconds per IP |

### Layer 5: CI/CD Pipeline

| Control | Detail |
|---|---|
| Selective builds | Only build containers whose source files changed |
| Trivy scanning | Critical/high CVEs → fail the build |
| Dependency scanning | `govulncheck` (Go), `npm audit` (JS) — fail on critical vulns |
| Secret scanning | `trufflehog` / `git secrets` — fail if secrets detected |
| Supply chain | Base images pinned by digest, not tag |
| SBOM generation | SPDX SBOM per image, attached to GitHub release |
